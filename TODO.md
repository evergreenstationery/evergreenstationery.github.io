# TODO: Use evergreenlogo.jpeg as website logo and site icon

- [ ] Add favicon link in the <head> section of index.html
- [ ] Replace the text logo in the nav with an <img> tag pointing to evergreenlogo.jpeg
- [ ] Adjust the CSS for .logo to style the image appropriately (set width/height, remove text-specific styles)
- [ ] Test the website to ensure the logo displays correctly and the favicon appears in the browser tab
